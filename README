The wsd daemon terminates websockets and multiplexes their frames to
some backend using proxy protocol 2 (PP2). At the websocket interface,
it implements a practical subset of the websocket protocol as defined
by RFC 6455. It is designed to be reasonably fast by minimising system
calls, memory copying and runtime memory allocation.

The wscat command writes to and reads from a remote system via web‚Äê
socket protocol RFC 6455. It reads from standard input and writes to
standard output. The command can be used interactively and
non-interactively.

See wsd(8) and wscat(8).
